     <h1>Our history</h1>
     <div>
       Since 2020, Karem started to learn to code, first with FreeCodeCamp where she learned the basics of Javascript.
       Afterwards, she completed a fullstack bootcamp where she successfully learned advanced technologies such as:
       React, Nodejs, Express, Axios, etc.
       However, she realized that pair programming was highly benefitial to her as when talked out with a classmate about 
       a coding issue, she sometimes had a better understanding of a problem. 
       Unfortunately there was nowhere where she could do pair programming once she has finished her bootcamp.
       So she decided to create 'Code Mate' for programmers of all
       levels wanting to improve their knowledge with other professionals. 
     </div>

     <h1>For whom is Code_Mate?</h1>
     Junior, medior and senior programmers looking for:
     - Learning a languaje or improve
     - Asking specific questions about an issue or technology
     - Develop their coding skills through pair programming
